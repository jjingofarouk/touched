They saved my life by organizing this camp, diagnosing me, and ensuring I got the right treatment. They even supported me financially so that I can manage my basic needs as I undergo treatment. May God bless them abundantly for their kindness and love for the people of Moroto.",
                "story": "Nalem Judith, a resident of Nakapirimen in Moroto District, had been unwell for months, suffering from persistent abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss, and general body weakness. With limited access to proper healthcare, she had resigned herself to enduring the pain, unaware of the severity of her condition. But hope arrived when Touched Hearts organized a medical camp in Moroto Municipality. Hearing about the free screenings and treatment, Nalem made her way to the camp, desperate for relief. She was warmly received and examined by a doctor who ordered several tests, including an ultrasound, GeneXpert, Liver Function Tests (LFTs), and Renal Function Tests (RFTs). The diagnosis was staggering: abdominal tuberculosis (TB) had spread to her liver and kidneys. Though overwhelmed, Nalem felt relieved to finally understand her suffering. Touched Hearts went beyond diagnosis—they arranged for her transfer to a hospital in Moroto for further evaluation and later admission to Moroto Regional Referral Hospital for extended treatment. They also provided financial assistance to cover her daily needs. With tears of gratitude, Nalem now has a fighting chance at recovery, thanks to Touched Hearts’ unwavering support."

                "quote": "This is a blessing. Many of our children come to school eager to learn, but they lack the necessary materials. Today, you have given them more than just books and pens—you have given them hope.",
                "story": "It was a bright Friday morning in Biraara Village, Kisoro District, when Rising Hope Model School buzzed with excitement. The children, mostly from the vulnerable Batwa community, gathered with wide eyes and eager hearts. Their school compound, typically a place of learning and play, became a stage for an extraordinary act of kindness. Robinson Byamukama and Solomon Ssekiranda, passionate advocates working with Touched Hearts and supported by the Indo-Africa Charitable Society, arrived with smiles and a mission: to deliver scholastic materials to 349 children who often lacked basic supplies. As books, pens, and pencils were handed out, the children’s faces lit up with joy. Tiny hands clutched their new treasures—some holding their very first personal books after years of sharing worn-out copies. Laughter and chatter filled the air, spreading contagious happiness. Headteacher Mr. Kamugisha expressed his gratitude, saying the donation was a blessing that empowered eager learners. Teacher Ms. Nankunda added that every child could now fully participate in class without feeling left out. As Robinson and Solomon departed, they left behind a legacy of hope, proving that small gifts can create immense impact in Biraara Village."

                "story": "During a Touched Hearts medical camp in Karamoja, team leaders Ssekiranda Solomon and Robinson heard about a disabled man who sat outside a supermarket daily, begging to survive. With no means of movement, he relied entirely on the kindness of passersby. Moved by his plight, the team visited him and witnessed his profound struggle firsthand. Determined to act, they partnered with the Indo Africa Charitable Organisation through Touched Hearts to provide him with a wheelchair. His name was Eminati Robert, and for years, his disability had trapped him in helplessness amidst Karamoja’s harsh realities. When the wheelchair was presented, his joy was palpable—a dream come true. For the first time in years, he felt seen and valued. The gift restored his mobility, dignity, and independence, opening doors to new opportunities. Eminati expressed heartfelt thanks, urging continued support for others like him in Karamoja. This single act reinforced Touched Hearts’ commitment to ensuring no one is left behind, turning Eminati’s daily struggle into a story of hope and renewal."
