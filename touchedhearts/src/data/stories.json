        "story": "Kaitesi, a resident of Nakapirimen in Moroto District, had been unwell for months, suffering from persistent abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss, and general body weakness. With limited access to proper healthcare, she had resigned herself to enduring the pain, unaware of the severity of her condition. But hope arrived when Touched Hearts organized a medical camp in Moroto Municipality. Hearing about the free screenings and treatment, Nalem made her way to the camp, desperate for relief. She was warmly received and examined by a doctor who ordered several tests, including an ultrasound, GeneXpert, Liver Function Tests (LFTs), and Renal Function Tests (RFTs). The diagnosis was staggering: abdominal tuberculosis (TB) had spread to her liver and kidneys. Though overwhelmed, Nalem felt relieved to finally understand her suffering. Touched Hearts went beyond diagnosis—they arranged for her transfer to a hospital in Moroto for further evaluation and later admission to Moroto Regional Referral Hospital for extended treatment. They also provided financial assistance to cover her daily needs. With tears of gratitude, Nalem now has a fighting chance at recovery, thanks to Touched Hearts’ unwavering support."
